  If the output is not working, please write it in the README.

pi: for having pi it is better to:

#include <numbers>
std::numbers::pi

or with constexpr instead of const, but stick with the header numbers.

Code design:
  main.cpp => the fact that you are allowing the user to employ less resources then the one provided at run time is a VERY BAD IDEA.
 Please always keep max_size = size.

  main1.cpp => sorry but it doesn't compile

  Also, another design would have put both the main.cpp and the main1.cpp in the makefile, with the user only having to tyke:
  make main
  make main1

  There is a bug somewhere in the code. Running the code with two cores shows no proper reconstruction of the solution.
  The code on one core seems to be working, but further testing is required.

Code output:
  the vtk cannot be opened in your original code.
  After a small debugging, indeed the vtk is wrong. It seems to me that you have a reconstruction problem and a problem in getting the right solution. The function to generate the vtk file provided: how can it be wrong?
